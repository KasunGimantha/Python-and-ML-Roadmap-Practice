Practice:

Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100

Write a loop that sums only even numbers from 1 to 100

Bonus: Write a number guessing game using a while loop (no help from me unless you're stuck)

Mini Challenge:

Write a Python program that asks a user to enter a number.

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".

If divisible by 5, print "Buzz".

If divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz".

Loop until the user types "exit".
