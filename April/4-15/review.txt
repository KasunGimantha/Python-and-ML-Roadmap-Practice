What is a function?
    function is a reusbale codeblock that sometimes include return values
Enhanced Answer:
    A function is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task. It can be reused multiple times and may or may not return a value. Think of it like a machine: you feed it inputs, it processes something, and might give you an output.     

What is the difference between parameters and arguments?
    parameter is acting like a placeholder for value.It catch the passed value from outside the function.Argument in other hand has a actual value.It is the thing that pass value into function when it called
Enhanced ANswer:
    Parameter â†’ variable in the function definition (like a label).

    Argument â†’ actual value you pass into the function during the call.

    ðŸ“Œ Example:

    python
    Copy
    Edit
    def greet(name):      # name â†’ parameter
        print("Hello", name)

    greet("Kasun")                



What does return actually do?

    return act as the output from the function..It output the value or statements as a result of whjy function created in the first place

Enhanced Answer:
